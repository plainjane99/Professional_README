## Description <a name="description"></a>
This application receives user input through the command line to generate a professional README.  The README includes Project Title, Table of Contents, Project Description, Installation Instructions, Usage Instructions, Contributing Information, Test Instructions, License Information, and a Contact Section.  All sections are required input to maintain the standard for professional README's.  Some prompts require user input while others have a default input that may be selected.
