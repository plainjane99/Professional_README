## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is a README file that was generated by the application I wrote for the Week 9 Node.js Challenge.  The Week 9 Challenge was to dynamically build a professional README file with information input by the user through prompts in the Command Line.  This file is meant to demonstrate that all standard README content is dynamically generated, including the information sections, a table of contents, and a badge for the license.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The README can be opened and previewed through VS Code.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The README dynamically generated through the command line but can then be editted as necessary through VS Code.

## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
No contribution is required for a README.

## Tests <a name="tests"></a>
No test code is required.  The README can be tested by clicking on the table of contents to ensure each link works.  

## License <a name="license"></a>
This application is covered under the MIT license.
